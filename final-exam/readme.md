# Final Exam

For the final exam, we are going to improve the code quality (readability/modularity, etc) of the tic-toc-toe game. Please study the script **[tic_toc_toe_messy.py](./tic_toc_toe_messy.py)** and make yourself familiar with it. Then:

1. Find all **TODO** items and see whether you can improve the code. In most cases (if not all), you can make them more readable/modular or pythonic!
2. Add/fix function's docstrings (use """ insted of # for function's header comments)
3. You may benefit from applying some refactorings before the others. For example, if there is a flag variable and you remove it, you would find it easier to apply the extract method technique.
4. You do **not** need to make the script comply with PEP 8.

# Where to submit:

Please submit the refactored version of **tic_toc_toe_messy.py** at **[Final Exam](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/206382/assignments/1065830)**
