# Final Exam

Please study the script **[tic_toc_toe_messy.py](./tic_toc_toe_messy.py)** and:

1. Find all **TODO** items and see whether you can improve the code. 
   In most cases (if not all), you can make them more readable/modular.
1. Add/fix function's docstrings (use """ insted of # for function's header
    comments)
1. You may benefit from applying some refactorings before the others. For example, if there is a flag variable and you remove it, you would find it easier to apply the extract method technique.

# Where to submit:

Please submit the refactored version of **tic_toc_toe_messy.py** at **[Final Exam](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/206382/assignments/1065830)**
